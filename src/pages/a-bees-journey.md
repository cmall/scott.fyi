# A Bee's Journey #

## My First Children's Book ##


It is my dream to be an author. I am excited to say my journey has begun. I wrote a story for kids. I just love writing. My friend Rachel agreed to illustrate the story. Her drawings brought my bee to life. I’m so happy with the final result. It’s just a fun story that can be used to teach the kids about the world and flowers.
