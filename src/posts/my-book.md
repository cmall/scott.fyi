Happy New Year! I’m so excited to have my book ready. I got the actual book just before Christmas and I love how it turned out.

It’s my dream to be an author and this book is getting me started. It’s a children’s book I wrote for fun. I just enjoyed writing it. My friend Rachel drew the awesome pictures. I really think it’s part of the way I am. The Bee I mean. He smells flowers and I have always smelled flowers. I enjoy the smell. Smell is a very important sense for me and I learn a lot from smelling things. My vision is poor and I only hear when my cochlear implant is on, which I only want on part of the time. Smell is the sense I rely on most.

I wanted my book to have a font that is easy to read. The words are on their own page with Atkinson Hyperlegible font. It is from the Braille Institute, designed for low vision. I named flowers and countries because the actual names of types of things are sometimes not told to kids. I think kids like to learn this.

I’m possibly getting very excited to show my book. It’s so cool to have an actual book printed with my name as the author. To have an ISBN number. But the best is seeing kids enjoying it. I had an idea of how I could make a book. It took a long time and it was hard, but I love it. It’s just so unbelievable that I can say I have a book.

I know I’m feeling really great. It’s just a kids book, but it’s so much more to me. It is the start of my future, it represents where I want to go. My passion for writing started when I learned I could type. Writing is my communication and it's allowed me to express myself in ways I could not before. It’s allowed me to become who I want to be. Thanks for reading my blog.
